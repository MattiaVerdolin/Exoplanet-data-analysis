# 🪐 Exoplanet Data Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This project is a **data analysis study** on exoplanets, developed as part of the **Data Science** course at **SUPSI - Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana**.  
The dataset used includes all **exoplanets discovered up to 2021**, sourced from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive**.  

The goal of this project is to **analyze trends in exoplanet discoveries**, study their characteristics, and explore relationships between planetary and stellar attributes.

## 🔍 Analysis Conducted

### 📈 **Basic Exoplanet Analysis**
- **Number of exoplanets discovered per year** → Trends in discovery rates.
- **Stars & planets per system** → How many stars and planets typically exist in a system?
- **Most massive and least massive exoplanets** → Distribution of planetary masses.
- **Comparison of stellar sizes** → Smallest known star vs. the Sun vs. the largest known star.

### 🔬 **Discovery Method Analysis**
- **Evolution of detection techniques** → How technology has changed over time.
- **Distribution of planetary distances by discovery method** → Which methods detect closer vs. farther planets?
- **Discovery method vs. planetary mass & orbital distance** → How detection bias affects discovered planets.

### 📡 **Other Investigations**
- **Leading observatories in exoplanet discoveries** → Which telescopes contribute the most?
- **Relationships between mass, orbital period & semi-major axis** → Identifying planetary formation patterns.
- **Comparison of mass, gravity & stellar radius** → Understanding planetary composition.
